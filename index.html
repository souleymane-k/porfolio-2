       <h3>Hello! I'm souleymane Kone.</h3>
          <p> I would like to introduce myself to give you a better understanding of my person. I live in pinole California which is 23 miles from San Francisco. Currently, I’m managing a non-profit organization which operates in rural Africa especially in the Ivory Coast. We fight against chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Our actions aim to provide diabetes test kits and other anti-inflammatory medicines such as Tylenol, Ibuprofen. Besides, we work with local physicians and nurses who provide medical services allowing hundreds of people to have access to medical care. Better, we work with pharmacists who provide us with prescription drugs.</p>
          <p> To reach this level of activity, we work with stakeholders who provide financial assistance to pay for expenses. We work also with other non-profit organizations and government agencies to implement our projects.</p>

            <p>Web development has become a hobby for me. Every single day, I'm online learning about coding. Before starting at Thinkful, I have been involved in creating a web page for fun. Also, I have developed friendships with people invested in software development. I live in an environment where we have developed a community of web developers. Therefore, I'm willing to share ideas on new projects and work with other software developers.</p>

        <h4>Know Your Numbers </h4>
         <p>This project consists of helping individuals, diabetes patients to input their glycemic data in an application that will output whether or not their glycemic level is in the normal range or not. The app should be able to give a descriptive graph with different colors showing the result. The green color will be assigned the normal range and red will represent the none normal one. When checking the glycemic level, there is a stage called the Pre-diabetic stage. Consequently,  that stage will be represented by yellow color. The number of tests will depend on the individuals and their physicians. In general, individuals can perform three tests daily, the first one before eating anything in the morning and the second one, two hours after eating lunch, and the last one before going to bed.  The target population is the general population and medical doctors or hospitals, and medical clinics. This App will allow individuals, on one hand, to create and store data that can provide them a visual reading of their data and on the other hand, the app also could help medical doctors and medical practitioners quickly access patients' results for up to three weeks of input data.</p>
